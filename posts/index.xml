and game development. I have been making games by myself and with
friends for about 8 years now. My plan is pursue game development as more than
just a hobby. I want to document that process here.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care?</h2>
<p>I hope that by sharing my journey and process that I am able to help people who
are interested in developing games as a career or as a hobby. I also hope that I
can grow a community who enjoy discussing and making games together, and that
this group can be a part of the larger game dev community.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Eric Sexton. I&rsquo;m originally a self taught programmer who earned a BS in
Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. I worked all through college,
which is added up to 4 years of professional web development experience.
I obviously enjoy video games, but I also like to dabble in cooking and mixing
drinks.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-be-documenting">What are you going to be documenting?</h2>
<p>The main thing I will be documenting at the start will be work on my personal
projects. I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of trying to fully release a game I made
during a game jam with a group of friends. I also hope to document game jams I
do. I&rsquo;m interested in maybe streaming or video documenting my game jams since
so much happens in a couple of days, so look at for that. On top of that, I my
dream is to run my own indie studio so hopefully I can document that road to
chasing that goal.</p>
<h2 id="when--where-should-i-look-for-stuff">When / Where should I look for stuff?</h2>
<p>Obviously, this website is a good place. My goal is to start with weekly dev logs
on this website, and then as I get comfortable, I want to try different types of
content like video and streaming. I will announce if and when those things are
coming.</p>
