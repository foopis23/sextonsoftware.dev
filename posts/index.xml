<p>In last week&rsquo;s devlog, I was able to add a multiplayer menu, lobby, and ready up
system to my old game jam project, Temple of Chaos. This week, I would like to continue
adding multiplayer to the game. I am going to be using Mirror and Steamworks Fizzy.
Like I said last time, this is my first time making a multiplayer game with steamworks,
so a lot of this is a learning experience. The plan is that I&rsquo;m going to try to
get player movement synced over the network, after that I&rsquo;m going to start looking
into how single-player works in am multiplayer game to see if I can reuse my multiplayer code.
If I have time, I am going to try to get to get projectiles to sync of the network.</p>
<h2 id="daily-log">Daily Log</h2>
<h3 id="monday">Monday</h3>
<p>Today, I had to stay late at work to get some stuff done for an upcoming deadline.
When I got home, I decided to take a bit of a mental break by laying down and watching
some youtube. Once I was feeling a bit better, I got up and finished up the devlog from
last week and then made some edits to the website. Its quite late now, but I&rsquo;m going
to try to start working on player movement.</p>
<p>I took my awhile to figure out how I was going to spawn the players and get them
into the next scene. I ended up overriding the change scene method in the network
manager to destroy the objects that I was using as player objects in the lobby
and spawn new player objects for the in game players. After this I had to strip
down my existing player prefab to be only player movement because changing the
player movement script to a duplicate script that adds the necessary logic
for multiplayer broke other scripts attached to the player. High coupling and low
cohesion in a dream. I think its working, but I realized I need to make a new steam
account and setup the project on my laptop if I want to test it. So I&rsquo;m going to
bed.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h3>
<p>I woke up and had a nice cup of coffee. I got up and started working on testing&hellip;
Just kidding :). After I a late night of programming, I woke up late for work.
Luckily its not a huge deal if I&rsquo;m a little bit late to my current job. Also, I know
this isn&rsquo;t like the glamorous, I just really love game dev and programming log
right now but I figure its best to just be authenticate. I&rsquo;m tired and sometimes
programming makes me feel like I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing even after
year of experience and a degree.</p>
<p>That said, I was talking with Jamac, the other developer that worked on the game
jam version of the game with me, about the progress I was making on the project
and it really lifted my spirits. He said he could hop on a call to help me test
once we both got home from work. It didn&rsquo;t work. There were a lot of bugs. My
plan is to setup my laptop for testing the project, and then I&rsquo;m going to iron
out all of the bugs so that I can see if player movement is working or not.</p>
<p>I finally got the loading into the test multiplayer scene and network synced
player movement working. It was most just a lot of configuring and then some
small code changes.</p>
<p>Here is a clip of spawning into the multiplayer test scene
and moving around. I only have the video from desktop player&rsquo;s perspective but
the other player is the game running on my laptop. I also made these little capsule
models so we can see the other players moving around.

</video>
</p>
<p>There is still a small bug where it looks like a player joins a lobby twice or
something&hellip; Its not game breaking but it does throw an error and cause the
editor to pause. I&rsquo;m going to try to work that out.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t keep up with my devlog, so this is future me say&hellip; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure
what I did this day. I think I took a break because I was a bit tired from work.</p>
<p>Side note, I did start working on a portfolio section of the site during my lunch break. Hopefully
I can add that soon to display my work in one place.</p>
<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>
<p>I worked on making interfaces for a lot of the original scripts in the game. Some
of the singleplayer code is reusable, but I it references code that I had to rewrote for
multiplayer, so I hade to make interfaces for almost everything I referenced. This
was all in the hope of getting projectiles working in the multiplayer scene.</p>
<p>Also, at some point in this process I decided that I wanted to import the existing
lighting and level geometry into the multiplayer scene. I think this was mostly
because I needed a motivation boost after writing all of these interfaces and
having no progress to visual show for it. Here is what that looks like</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>
<p>I decided to participate in the GMTK 2022 Game Jam so Temple of Chaos went on
pause for the weekend. I&rsquo;m going to talk about my experience with the jam here because
I don&rsquo;t think I have enough to say about for merit its own post. I worked with
Jamac (James Dumas) and Josh Hovis on this game. James was the main programmer,
Josh was the artist, and I was the sort of guy who did a lot of the levels, the
menu systems, and I did decent amount of programming try my best to avoid conflicting
with Jamac. Our game was a dice rolling puzzle game sort of inspired by bloxorz.
It was a lot of fun, just like game jams in the past, though I was a little sad
because on of our teammates had covid, we we had to do it from home instead of
meeting up a central location. As always, it left me exhausted on Sunday and that
carried into Monday. That said we did a pretty good job on getting sleep, I just
think having your brain fire on all clinders for 16+ hours a day is a lot. I will
leave a link to our game here.</p>

After investigating Github and Trello, I realized that I just finished updating the Unity Editor Version, updating the project to the Universal Render Pipeline, and updating to the new Unity Input System.

<p>I have been out of the project for a couple of weeks, so the first step is to
figure out where I finished off and what is next. After investigating Github and
Trello, I realized that I just finished updating the Unity Editor Version,
updating the project to the Universal Render Pipeline, and updating to
the new Unity Input System. I also did some general code clean up. I am going to
stop there on cleanup and updating for now, and create a release as this point.</p>
<p>After creating this release, my plan is to start prototyping multiplayer into
the game. I think playing this with friends will give it the same vibes as
grinding COD Zombies or Risk of Rain 2 with the boys. Its the way I like to
enjoy these types of games. Because of that, I want to make sure I design the game to be
multiplayer friendly so that I don&rsquo;t push to far, and then realize that it would
be to much to add multiplayer it in the future.  My hope is that this will take about 2
weeks to finish with the current size of the game.My first step in setting up a
multiplayer prototype is going to be getting the lobby screen working. I am
going to be using Mirror and Steamworks Fizzy. This is my first time making a
multiplayer game using steamworks. Fingers crossed that it goes smoothly.</p>
<p>I have also decided to go closed source with the game moving forward. My hope is
that I can eventually sell this game, and I don&rsquo;t want people compiling from
source and redistrubuting. That said, my hope is that some amount of time after
release I would like to release the source code for modding and port, etc. I will
also keep the source code open source for what I have done up until this point.
As I don&rsquo;t want to yank it down. Its just anything moving forward will not be
publish to that repository.</p>
<h2 id="daily-log">Daily Log</h2>
<h3 id="monday">Monday</h3>
<p>Did nothing. It was vacation day :-)</p>
<h3 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h3>
<p>Was feeling a little under the weather, so I took another day to myself.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h3>
<p>I wrote code off and on from 5pm to midnight. I was having trouble focusing. That
said, I was able to implement a simple lobby system following this
<a  href="https://youtu.be/7Eoc8U8TWa8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Youtube Tutorial</a>

made by <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZygerGFX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Zyger</a>
.
I then got names and profile pictures to show up on the lobby screen. I still need
to test if other people can join since I do not have 2 steam accounts. I&rsquo;m hoping
to clean up the lobby UI and then move on to a ready up system tomorrow.</p>

    <img src="/img/posts/toc-devlog-1/lobby.PNG"  alt="Lobby Screenshot"  class="left"  />


<h3 id="thursday">Thursday</h3>
<p>So I started today by cleaning up the UI elements I made yesterday. A lot of
scaling issues and edge cases I tried to fix. I also added a multiplayer button to the
game&rsquo;s existing main menu to take you to the multiplayer testing menu so now I
can compile the game and send it to people for testing. Its around 9pm, I just
ate dinner, and I&rsquo;m going to try to finish the ready up system before I got to bed.</p>

    <img src="/img/posts/toc-devlog-1/main-menu.PNG"  alt="Main Menu with New Multiplayer Button"  class="left"  />


<p>I got the ready up system working. It was easier than I thought now that I have
a good foundation. I also took the time the style the UI to look more like the
existing menu in the game. Its not final, but I had a little time and it made
me feel like I got a win.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="friday">Friday</h3>
<p>I went out with a friend from high school after work so I didn&rsquo;t work on the
game.</p>
<h3 id="saturday">Saturday</h3>
<p>I spent the day preparing for my move that is coming up in the next month. No
work this day.</p>
<h3 id="sunday">Sunday</h3>
<p>I spend the day with my Girlfriend, so no more work.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Honestly, I was hope that I would be able to get a little more done this week. I don&rsquo;t think I will make my two week goal at this pace xD.
That said, I&rsquo;m happy that I was able to get the lobby system up and working. I think that making any progress I can helps keep the project going.
I hope next week that I can start working on porting the player movement to
support multiplayer. After this, I want to see if I can still use the
multiplayer movement to play the game single-player offline or if I need to have
need to find a way to reuse code between multiplayer fps controller and
single-player fps controller. I think that will take up most of next week,
but maybe I can also start on projectiles as well.</p>

for free, this is the place for you. I am going to walk through the steps I took

<p>I know this site is mostly to document my game developer journey, but I think

<h2 id="0-prerequisites">0. Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
<li>A Github account and basic experience using git.</li>
<li>An understanding of how to add a program to path on your operating system or
knowledge on how to use your OS&rsquo;s package manager.</li>
<li>Some kind of code or text editor software.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-install-hugo">1. Install Hugo</h2>
<p>There are a few methods for installing Hugo on your machine. Probably the best
solution is using homebrew, as it requires the least setup. If you do not have
homebrew, then you can download a binary of Hugo from github releases and add
the binary to your system path. See the link down below for more details.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="2-create-hugo-project">2. Create Hugo Project</h2>
<p>Next we need to create a new project. Open your command line and navigate to the
directory you want to create the project directory in. Then run this command.
<strong>Make sure to replace &lt;project-name&gt; with whatever you want to call your project.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new site &lt;project-name&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command will create a new directory in the current directory. To enter the
project from the command line, run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd &lt;project-name&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that you are in the project directory, run the following command
to initialize this project as a git project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git init
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, add a file named <code>.gitignore</code> to the project directory. This file will be used to
ignore files that you do not want to include in the project. Paste the following
text into the file.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Generated files by hugo
/public/
/resources/_gen/
/assets/jsconfig.json
hugo_stats.json

# Executable may be added to repository
hugo.exe
hugo.darwin
hugo.linux

# Temporary lock file while building
/.hugo_build.lock
</code></pre><h2 id="3-adding-a-theme">3. Adding a theme</h2>
<p>Now we need to add a theme to the site. If you don&rsquo;t plan to modify the src code
for the theme to much, the best option is to add it as a git submodule (that way you can
get updates for the theme down the line with one command). A lot of themes will
have commands to add the theme as a submodule. There is a list of themes on <a  href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Hugo&#39;s websites</a>
. For my
website, I am using the <a  href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >hello-friend-ng theme</a>

by <a  href="https://atlialp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Djordje Atlialp</a>
. I
am going to walk through how I added that to my site.</p>
<p>Once in the project directory, run the following command to add the theme as a
submodule.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You will find a <strong>config.toml</strong> in your project directory. Open that in your
preferred text editor and paste the following defaults for the theme.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">baseurl</span>      = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;localhost&#34;</span>

<h2 id="4-adding-content">4. Adding Content</h2>
<p>Finally, the part we have been waiting for, we get to create content. To create
new content with all the  necessary meta tags we will use the <code>hugo new</code>
command. To create a new blog post. Run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now if you open that new content file in a text editor, located at
<code>&lt;project-dir&gt;/content/posts/my-first-post.md</code>, you will see something like
this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t have all of this, some themes add different meta tags
to posts. The important part is that at the top of your file you have a block of
text surrounded with <code>---</code>. Right under this block you can just start typing.
All of the content is made in markdown while allows you to do simple styling.
Here is a <a  href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Markdown Cheatsheet</a>

get you starter.</p>
<p>An example of a page might look something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-md" data-lang="md"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Hello this is my first blog posts. I just wanted to say hi.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Who Am I?
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>Im the guy who created this blog.
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="5-start-the-hugo-server">5. Start the Hugo Server</h2>
<p>Now that we have our blog site, we need to start the server. To do this, we
will run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hugo server -D
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hugo server starts a server running on our local machine. The -D flag will
include draft content in the site for preview. In your command line, after
running that command, you should see a line that looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
</code></pre><p>This means that you can go to <code>http://localhost:1313/</code> in your browser to see your
site. You can make changes to the content and see the changes immediately.</p>
<h2 id="6-create-a-repository-on-github">6. Create a Repository on Github</h2>
<p>Now that we have a site, we need to create a repository on Github. This is
where you will be able to share your site with the world. To create a new repo
on github, you will need an account at <code>https://github.com</code>. Once you are signed
in you will be able to click the plus icon in the top right corner of the
screen and select <code>New Repository</code>. From there, you you can name your repo and
select the <code>Public</code> option. Leave everything else default or blank.</p>
<p>Now we need to push or local project to the github repository. To do this,
we will run the following commands in the project directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Initial commit&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git remote add origin git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git branch -M main
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push -u origin main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command will stage all of the changed files, commit them to the default
branch, add a remote origin for the project, set default branch&rsquo;s name to main
and push the main branch to the github repository.</p>
<h2 id="7-deploy-to-github-pages">7. Deploy to Github Pages</h2>
<p>Now that we have a repository on Github, we need to deploy it to Github Pages. To do
this we need to setup a <a  href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >github actions workflow.</a>

Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know exactly what this is. It is just a way to to automatic
build and deploy our website to github pages when we push our content to github.
To setup a workflow up, create a new directory called <code>.github</code> in the project directory.
Then in the <code>.github</code> directory, create a new directory called <code>workflows</code>. Then,
create a new workflow file called <code>main.yml</code>. In that file, paste the following.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">name</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">CI</span>

install hugo in the action container, build the project, and deploy the built site to
a new branch called gh-pages.</p>
<p>Next you need to set the base url for your site. This is the url that will be
used to access your site. If you are not going to buy a domain and set it up for
this, then the baseurl will be <code>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo-name&gt;</code>. If you
do use a custom domain, then you can set the baseurl to <code>https://&lt;domain-name&gt;</code>.
To set the base url, open the <code>config.toml</code> file in the project directory and set
the baseurl to the domain you will be using.</p>
<p>After this is added, you can run the following command to push your code to github.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="8-setup-github-pages-on-repository">8. Setup Github Pages on Repository</h2>
<p>The last thing we need to do is to setup Github Pages on our repository. To do this,
we will need to go the repository settings page. You can find this on your Github
repository page by clicking the gear icon in the nav bar. Its the button farthest
to the right. Once in the settings page, you can click the <code>Pages</code> tab in the left
side nav. From there, under &ldquo;Source&rdquo; section, you can select the
<code>gh-pages</code> branch and leave the folder set to <code>/(root)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="9-the-future--references">9. The Future / References</h2>
<p>You can now see your site in Github Pages. To add more content to your site, follow
the steps above for adding content and then to deploy it to Github Pages. Run the following
commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Content Update Message/Label&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Also if its easier for you to edit this files in the browser, you can press <code>.</code>
while on the github repository page and you will be able to edit files there.</p>

and game development. I have been making games by myself and with
friends for about 8 years now. My plan is pursue game development as more than
just a hobby. I want to document that process here.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-care">Why do I care?</h2>
<p>I hope that by sharing my journey and process that I am able to help people who
are interested in developing games as a career or as a hobby. I also hope that I
can grow a community who enjoy discussing and making games together, and that
this group can be a part of the larger game dev community.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Eric Sexton. I&rsquo;m originally a self taught programmer who earned a BS in
Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. I worked all through college,
which is added up to 4 years of professional web development experience.
I obviously enjoy video games, but I also like to dabble in cooking and mixing
drinks.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-be-documenting">What are you going to be documenting?</h2>
<p>The main thing I will be documenting at the start will be work on my personal
projects. I&rsquo;m currently in the middle of trying to fully release a game I made
during a game jam with a group of friends. I also hope to document game jams I
do. I&rsquo;m interested in maybe streaming or video documenting my game jams since
so much happens in a couple of days, so look at for that. On top of that, I my
dream is to run my own indie studio so hopefully I can document that road to
chasing that goal.</p>
<h2 id="when--where-should-i-look-for-stuff">When / Where should I look for stuff?</h2>
<p>Obviously, this website is a good place. My goal is to start with weekly dev logs
on this website, and then as I get comfortable, I want to try different types of
content like video and streaming. I will announce if and when those things are
coming.</p>
