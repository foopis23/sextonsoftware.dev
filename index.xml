I&amp;rsquo;m originally a self taught programmer who earned a BS in Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. I worked all through college, which is added up to 4 years of professional web development experience. I obviously enjoy video games, but I also like to dabble in cooking and mixing drinks.
My Goal My goal is to pursue a professional career in game development.
