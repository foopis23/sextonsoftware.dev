I&amp;rsquo;m originally a self taught programmer who earned a BS in Computer Science at Purdue University Fort Wayne. I worked all through college, which is added up to 4 years of professional web development experience. I obviously enjoy video games, but I also like to dabble in cooking and mixing drinks.
My Goal My goal is to pursue a professional career in game development. I plan on documenting that journey through this website.</description></item><item><title>The plan is simple...</title><link>https://sextonsoftware.dev/posts/the-plan-is-simple/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 16:16:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sextonsoftware.dev/posts/the-plan-is-simple/</guid><description>I have decided I want to make a change in my life.

I want to document that process here.
Why do I care? I hope that by sharing my journey and process that I am able to help people who are interested in developing games as a career or as a hobby.</description></item></channel></rss>
