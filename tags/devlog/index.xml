After investigating Github and Trello, I realized that I just finished updating the Unity Editor Version, updating the project to the Universal Render Pipeline, and updating to the new Unity Input System. I also did some general code clean up. I am going to stop there on cleanup and updating for now, and create a release as this point.</description></item></channel></rss>
