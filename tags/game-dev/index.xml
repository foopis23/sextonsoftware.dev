After investigating Github and Trello, I realized that I just finished updating the Unity Editor Version, updating the project to the Universal Render Pipeline, and updating to the new Unity Input System. I also did some general code clean up. I am going to stop there on cleanup and updating for now, and create a release as this point.</description></item><item><title>The plan is simple...</title><link>https://sextonsoftware.dev/posts/the-plan-is-simple/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 16:16:14 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://sextonsoftware.dev/posts/the-plan-is-simple/</guid><description>I have decided I want to make a change in my life. I have always loved games and game development. I have been making games by myself and with friends for about 8 years now. My plan is pursue game development as more than just a hobby. I want to document that process here.
Why do I care? I hope that by sharing my journey and process that I am able to help people who are interested in developing games as a career or as a hobby.</description></item></channel></rss>
