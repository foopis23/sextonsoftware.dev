I have always loved games and game development. I have been making games by myself and with friends for about 8 years now. My plan is pursue game development as more than just a hobby. I want to document that process here.
Why do I care? I hope that by sharing my journey and process that I am able to help people who are interested in developing games as a career or as a hobby.</description></item></channel></rss>
